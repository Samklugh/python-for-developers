# the debugger is a tool that helps you find and fix errors in your code. 
#to access the debugger in Python, you can use the built-in pdb module.
#here's a simple example of how to use the pdb module to debug a Python script.

#write a code and click on the red dot to set a breakpoint.
#when you run the script, the execution will stop at the breakpoint,
#and you can use various commands to inspect the state of your program.
#the commands include:
#- n (next): execute the next line of code
#- c (continue): continue execution until the next breakpoint
#- q (quit): exit the debugger

#click on the rundebug python file to start debugging.
