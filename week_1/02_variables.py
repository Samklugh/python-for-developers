#variables are used to store data that can be referenced and manipulated in a program. In Python, you can create a variable by assigning a value to it using the equals sign (=). Here are some examples of how to create and use variables in Python:


# Creating variables
name = "Alice"          # A string variable
age = 30                # An integer variable   
height = 5.5           # A float variable
is_student = True      # A boolean variable

#printng variables

print(name)
print(age)

#reassigning variables
age = 31

print(age)
